## Haiku fan SmartThings integration

This integration was written with the intent of enabling voice control using
the Google Assistant SmartThings integration.

engineering the Haiku fan protocol: https://bruce.pennypacker.org/category/haiku/

## Usage

In the voice control examples below, substitute "fan" with your actual fan name.

### Fan

* Turn on fan
* Turn off fan
* Set fan to 50%
* Turn up fan
* Turn down fan
* Brighten fan
* Dim fan

### Light

## Limitations

This device handler is unable to detect the current state of your fan's motor
and lights. If you adjust your fan with the remote control or Haiku's app, it
will go out of sync with SmartThings.

## SmartThings Edge driver

Details coming soon.

## SmartThings device handler

This device handler creates a hidden child device named `${fan name} light`. If
you name your fan "Study Room Fan", a "Study Room Fan Light" hidden device will
be created. It will not appear in your Things list, but can be added as a
switch to Smart Apps, such as the Google Assistant integration.
